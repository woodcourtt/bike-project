# Bike Project

## Short Description

This project is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi. It is built on Johnny-Five. Simply connect the NO reed switch of a bike trainer to pin 7. Place a video, named video.mp4 in the public folder, run the application, open a browser and visit the Pi, by entering its IP-addrress in your browser. Now step on your bike and cycle.
